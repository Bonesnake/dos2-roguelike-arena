# Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Roguelike Arena

Welcome to the official repository of the Roguelike Arena mod from Divinity: Original Sin 2! If you wish to create a patch mod or look at the source code, you're at the right place. Otherwise, you should head to the [mod's Steam page](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3254033921).

You can modify and browse the mod to your heart's content but don't forget to credit me or link to the mod's page if you publish your work. If you create a mod that depends on this one and send me a link to it I'll make sure to display it on the mod's page so more people can find it.

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me here or on [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/bonesnake/).
